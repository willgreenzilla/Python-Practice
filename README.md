# Python-Practice
Collection of Python scripts built while working on learning Python.

# hangman.py
Simple hangman script modified from The Self Taught Programmer by Cory Althoff.

This is a very simple Python script hangman game modified from The Self Taught Programmer to add some extra functionality while I am learning Python.

Added the following above what was in the original script:

1) Pulls a random 7 letter or less word from /usr/share/dict/words (Linux) and strips 's from the end of any word.
2) Keeps track of incorrectly guessed letters and displays this list to the player.
3) Error checks selection and only allows selection of a letter (no numbers and symbols).

Issues:

Currently only works on Linux... I need to fix random word selection in Windows still.

# PlayWAR.py
Card game example from the hangman example in The Self-Taught Programmer by Cory Althoff.

Currently this simple WAR card game script is a direct copy from The Self-taught Programmer book. I plan to modify this and play around with it to continue learning Python.
